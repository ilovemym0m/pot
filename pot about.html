      We are benefiting the students with our business provided to help comfort them when they are agitated,
      some of these circumstances developed in young minds, especially in the black communities due to the disparities
      of the Covid-19 pandemic, causing antisocial activities, anxiety, and lackadaisical behaviors.
    </p>
   
    <h2>Who are we starting this business for?</h2>
    <p>This business is for children, and we hope to help them by using various calming methods. Due to the number of
      people around the world that face mental challenges, our company will allow others to pay cheap affordable prices
      so they can get the serenity they need.</p>

    <ul>To help those with unrest going through impenetrable times.</ul>

       the M.A.C.A.D.E.M.Y School of Science of Technology because some people struggle to get through an entire day of school
       without getting furious, so this business is to change that. </p>
